# enviroCar Notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks for different enviroCar related anaylsis

## Get started
For installing all required packages you can either use Conda or Pip. Therefore, this repo comes with an _environment.yml_ and a _requirements.txt_ in this repository, respectively.

## Log analyzing
Create a log report from the enviroCar Android App with detailed logging enabled and copy it into the _./data_ folder. The _enviroCar_log_analyzing_ notebook shows how to parse and analyze the log reports.
